# Parallel Neural Networks

Hey!, this little project searches to explore the world of neural networks from ground up as some kind of crazy laboratory.

You'll find numerated folders where there is a small C++ project with a neural net, each incremental in a numerated folder hopes to improve the implementation over the previous, mainly focusing on the capabilities of this AI methods on parallelization

## 1 - Sequential Multilayer Perceptron

This folder contains a simple Multilayer Perceptron with sequential forward feeding and sequential backpropagation
